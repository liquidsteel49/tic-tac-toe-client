My tic-tac-toe project

I started off not really knowing where to begin so I wanted to make sure that I took the time to orginaize my workspace and desktop space. From there I set up my Trillo and took the approach of organizing as far out as I could while setting specific tasks. When I have something too far on the horizon for me to know what task must really be done I put that in a second of Trillo to see the goal and when I get closer to it I have the reminder to write out more of the goals.

Planning to start off each day with a review of the requirements so that I never lose sight of the goals of the project.
